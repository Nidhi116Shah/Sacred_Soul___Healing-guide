        <h3>🌿 What Is Shatavari?</h3>

        Shatavari (<i>Asparagus racemosus</i>) is a climbing plant native to India and parts of Asia. Its roots are the
        most medicinal part and have been used in Ayurvedic medicine for centuries to support reproductive health,
        hormonal balance, and emotional grounding.<br><br>

        It is a powerful <b>adaptogen</b> — helping the body adapt to stress, restore balance, and build long-term
        resilience.<br><br>

        <h3>🌼 Benefits of Shatavari</h3>

        Shatavari is known for its deeply nourishing and cooling properties. Here are some of its key benefits:<br><br>

        <b>✨ 1. Supports Female Reproductive Health</b><br>
        Shatavari is renowned for balancing hormones, easing PMS and menstrual discomfort, and supporting fertility.
        It’s also used during menopause to soothe hot flashes, dryness, and emotional shifts.<br><br>

        <b>✨ 2. Promotes Emotional Stability</b><br>
        Shatavari calms the nervous system, supporting mental clarity and emotional resilience. It’s helpful during
        times of stress, grief, or transition — especially for those who feel emotionally depleted.<br><br>

        <b>✨ 3. Enhances Vitality and Strength</b><br>
        As a rejuvenative (rasayana), Shatavari helps rebuild the body after illness, stress, or fatigue. It improves
        strength, stamina, and endurance over time.<br><br>

        <b>✨ 4. Supports Lactation and Postpartum Recovery</b><br>
        In Ayurveda, Shatavari is often given to new mothers to promote milk production, restore energy, and gently heal
        the body after childbirth.<br><br>

        <b>✨ 5. Cools Internal Heat</b><br>
        With its naturally cooling energy, Shatavari helps calm inflammation and internal “pitta” (Ayurvedic fire),
        making it helpful for skin irritations, digestive imbalances, and heat-related hormonal issues.<br><br>
