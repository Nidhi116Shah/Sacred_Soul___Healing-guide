        <h2>🌿 Black Seed: An Ancient Remedy for Modern Wellness</h2>
        <i>Shared with reverence by Sacred Soul</i><br><br>

        Among the world’s most cherished herbal remedies, one tiny seed has carried the reputation of being a “cure for
        everything but death.” That seed is <b>Black Seed</b>, also known as <i>Nigella sativa</i> or <i>Kalonji</i> — a
        deeply respected plant in many traditional healing systems, including Ayurveda, Unani, and ancient Middle
        Eastern medicine.<br><br>

        At <b>Sacred Soul</b>, we honor plants that offer profound support for the body, mind, and spirit. Black Seed is
        one such herb — small in size, but incredibly rich in healing potential.<br><br>

        <h3>🌱 What Is Black Seed?</h3>

        Black Seed comes from the Nigella sativa plant, native to Southwest Asia. The seeds are jet-black, slightly
        bitter, and aromatic — often used in traditional cuisine, but also prized as a natural medicine for thousands of
        years.<br><br>

        The oil extracted from these seeds is especially potent. It contains powerful compounds like
        <b>thymoquinone</b>, which has been extensively studied for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and
        immune-supporting properties.<br><br>

        <h3>🌼 Benefits of Black Seed</h3>

        Black Seed has long been used as a natural remedy for a wide range of conditions. Here are some of its most
        appreciated benefits:<br><br>
