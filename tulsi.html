        <h1>🌿 Tulsi: The Sacred Protector</h1>


        <p><span class="highlight">Tulsi</span>, also known as Holy Basil, is more than just a plant — it’s a sacred
            presence in Ayurvedic tradition and Indian households. With its rich aroma, immune-supportive qualities, and
            deeply calming nature, Tulsi is considered a spiritual herb — one that aligns body, mind, and soul.</p>

        <p>At <span class="highlight">Sacred Soul</span>, we honor Tulsi not just as an herb, but as a healer and
            protector. It’s a plant that teaches balance, invites clarity, and strengthens your connection with nature’s
            intelligence.</p>

            <h2>🌱 What Is Tulsi?</h2>
            <p><span class="highlight">Ocimum sanctum</span>, or Tulsi, is a fragrant leafy plant native to India. It is
                revered in Ayurveda as a <b>"rasayana"</b> — a rejuvenating herb — and in spiritual traditions as a
                sacred guardian that purifies energy and space.</p>
            <p>There are several varieties of Tulsi, including Rama, Krishna, and Vana — all with slightly different
                flavors but similar healing properties.</p>
