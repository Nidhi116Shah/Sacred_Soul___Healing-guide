        <h3>üåº Key Benefits of Manjishtha</h3>

        Here are the most celebrated ways Manjishtha supports health and vitality:<br><br>

        <b>‚ú® 1. Purifies the Blood</b><br>
        Manjishtha helps remove toxins and heat from the bloodstream, supporting clear skin, balanced emotions, and a
        healthy immune response.<br><br>

        <b>‚ú® 2. Supports Clear, Glowing Skin</b><br>
        By detoxifying the blood and lymph, Manjishtha addresses the root cause of many skin concerns ‚Äî such as acne,
        pigmentation, inflammation, and dullness.<br><br>

        <b>‚ú® 3. Balances the Lymphatic System</b><br>
        The lymph system helps transport waste and toxins out of the body. Manjishtha enhances this process, supporting
        a stronger immune system and lighter, more energized body.<br><br>

        <b>‚ú® 4. Calms Inflammation</b><br>
        This herb has natural anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which help soothe internal heat, swelling,
        and chronic irritation in the body.<br><br>

        <b>‚ú® 5. Hormonal Support</b><br>
        Manjishtha is often used in Ayurvedic care for menstrual and hormonal balance ‚Äî easing PMS symptoms and
        supporting reproductive health in women.<br><br>

        <b>‚ú® 6. Emotional Clarity</b><br>
        In Ayurveda, the blood carries not just nutrients but also emotional imprints. By cleansing the blood,
        Manjishtha is thought to help release stagnant emotions and promote a sense of peace.<br><br>
